# leighs-featherwings
Various feathers and featherwings of my own design. 
This repo currently in a state of disarray and abandonment.

I designed an [Adafruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification) form factor board based around an ESP32-S2 microcontroller module, driven out of the need for a suitable devboard for some of my projects. 

Featherwings for power+CAN, bluetooth audio, and I2S audio output, were also designed to accompany the ESP32-S2 feather. These were all intended to be used together, in various car-related projects.

The BM83 bluetooth audio featherwing was successful when used with a [UDA1334 DAC](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2s-stereo-decoder-uda1334a), but it was incompatible with my own DAC featherwing due to I2S timing mis-configurations.

As many of these parts became unavailable in 2020 onward, development ceased. 
Going forward, lessons learnt from these PCBs will be applied to the [saab-93NG-bluetooth-aux](https://github.com/leighleighleigh/saab-93NG-bluetooth-aux) and [saab-93NG-HPD-hacker](https://github.com/leighleighleigh/saab-93NG-HPD-hacker) projects.
