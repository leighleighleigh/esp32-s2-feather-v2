# esp32-s2-feather-v2
Various feathers and featherwings of my own design.

# TODO
bm83-featherwing
- replace USB connection with a UART one, maybe remove altogether. (USB didn't work)
- breakout GPIO?
- change LED/BUTTON stuff? (only needed for DFU upgrades)

dac-featherwing-v2
- create with new audio codec ICs
- match pinout to BM83 and FEATHER pins
